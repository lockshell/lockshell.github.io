- 如果我们的敌人激烈的批评和反对我们，我们一定是做了什么非常正确的事情。—— 毛泽东
- If our enemies fiercely criticize and oppose us, we must have done something very right.


- 民主国家的政治变化很快，严厉的制裁最多只能延续几年。
外国商人会向他们的政府施压改善对华关系，以便他们能够进入中国市场；外国政府也会重新认识到需要中国的合作。
中国要站稳立场，鼓励外国友人终止制裁，为好好利用将来的每一个机会做好准备。—— 邓小平
- Political changes in democracies are fast, and severe sanctions can only last for a few years. 
Foreign businessmen will pressure their governments to improve their relations with China so that they can enter the Chinese market; foreign governments will also recognise the need for China's cooperation. 
China must stand firm and encourage foreign friends to end the sanctions and prepare for every opportunity in the future.


- 中国的科技在进步，美国不能忍受中国科技进步。这会损害美国的长远利益。
- China's science and technology are advancing, and the United States cannot tolerate China's scientific and technological progress. This will harm the long-term interests of the United States.


- 依靠美元霸权，美国赚的盆盈钵满，正是由于美元经济给能带给美国惊人的利益，谁要是挑战美国的美元霸权，美国就会玩命的跟他死磕到底。
- Relying on the US dollar hegemony, the United States earned a huge profit. It is precisely because the US dollar economy can bring amazing benefits to the United States. If any country challenges the US dollar hegemony, the United States will hit him into ash.


- 川普当然知道中美贸易逆差其实是双方得利，缩减逆差纯属借口，目的很明确就是遏制中国产业升级，确保美国自己继续赚取超额利润。<br>
- Trump certainly knows that the trade deficit between China and the United States is actually a benefit for both sides. It is an excuse to reduce the deficit. The purpose is clear to hinder China's industrial upgrading and ensure that the United States itself continues to earn excess profits.


- 一段时间以来，一些美国政客揣着同一个唱本，满世界污蔑中伤中国，到处煽风点火，挑拨离间，言行令人不齿。
谎言就是谎言，说上一千遍还是谎言，蓬佩奥先生可以休矣！—— 陆慷<br>
- I need to point out that for quite some time, certain US politicians have been touring the globe with the same script in their pockets to smear China, starting fires and fanning the flames and sowing discords. Such behaviors are really beneath their dignity. 
A lie will remain a lie, even if repeated a thousand times. Monsieur Pompeo might as well take a break.


- 对于美方各种花式“甩锅”，对不起，我们不想接，也不能接。——华春莹
- The US wants to make China a scapegoat. But so sorry, we don't want to be one. And don't even think of making us one.
(scapegoat，作名词指替罪羊)
