There is an interesting api on [https://ghchart.rshah.org/](https://ghchart.rshah.org/)

It can display your Github chart information as an image. 
<!--more-->
e.g. the Github chart of `Flask`:

![GitHub Chart](https://ghchart.rshah.org/flask)

It's very easy to use it. Append your Github username behind the domain [https://ghchart.rshah.org/](https://ghchart.rshah.org/)

For example, in html page, you can put the URL in an `img` tag.
```
<img alt="GitHub Chart" src="https://ghchart.rshah.org/flask" >
```

In the markdown file, you can do like below.
```
![GitHub Chart](https://ghchart.rshah.org/flask)
```
